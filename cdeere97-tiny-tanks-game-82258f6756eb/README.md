# README #

This is a demo project to show how to go about setting up a simple node heirarchy system for a simple game.
This demo also shows how to use the math library to move and rotate a sprite.

This project will fail to bulid as the math library component has been omitted, as this is part of your assessment.
There is however a demonstration build available in the folder 'Build' that you can run to view the completed code.
